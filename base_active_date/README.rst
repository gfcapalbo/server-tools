================
Base Active Date
================

This module provides an mixin model, active.date, that provides an active
field that is computed, based on a start date and an end date. A cron job
is provided that will recompute the active state every night. There is also
a provision for on the fly recomputation.

Fields provided by this mixin
-----------------------------

* active - computed from start- and enddate
* active_date_start
* active_date_end

A record is active when current date greater then or equal to startdate,
or startdate nt filled, and when date less then enddate or enddate not
filled

Methods provided by this mixin
------------------------------

* _compute_active - will compute active from start- and enddates. Can be
  overridden in inheriting models.
* active_refresh - can be called to recompute active for all records in
  model
